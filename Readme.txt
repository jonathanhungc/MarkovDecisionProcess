I parsed the input from mdp_input, and took the values for the MDP from there. To run the program,
just make sure that the correct input file name is in the main method, and that the format of the
file is similar to the one in the sample input, so the program can parse it correctly. My output
should be similar to the sample output provided in the assignment.
